## 🎬 How to get started? <a name = "get-started" ></a>
To get started working on our editor you need to do a couple of things:

If you are wanna be the part of the team: 
1. You need to **add** something to the project and make a **PR**, just for us to make sure that you can work with us (We need to test you and trust you in the first place), however if you are already in the team ignore this step.
3. Create your branch with your name and the feature that you are currently working on. *gaborhadhazy/authentication* 
4. Check this [Working Flow](#working-flow)
5. Make sure to keep in tocuh every with your teammates and discuss everything. :D 
***Note***: Make sure to pull the changes logically whenever you're done with something make sure to pull, to avoid merge conflicts. 

If are just wanna contribute and support us:

## 👨‍💻 Working flow <a name = "working-flow"></a>
We try to work in utmost efficiency. If our developers finish something like a global or something bigger will need to make a PR to the branch ***dev***,  and the teammates need to check what you've done so far and review your changes. We either will approve it and apply it to the dev branch, or we discuss more. Once your changes are implemented in the dev branch, we're gonna test it out and try to find as much bug as we can in our deployed site. Eventually at the end of each week we will merge the dev branch with the ***main*** *production* branch and that's it. 

 ***Tip***: Try to take advantages while in a PR, create issues and making it as clear as possible 
 
 ## 👋 Run our project <a name = "run-project"></a>
You can start our project and run it locally, just to see where are we at. You can clone the project and you can run the dev branch, like this: 
```
npm run dev
```
However if you just wanna see the website and not the code itself then you can reach out to this link: `link goes here`
</br>
</br>
***Note***: Make sure to run `npm install`before running the project, and make sure that *Node* is installed as well
</br>

## 📁 Our folder structure <a name="folder" ></a>
Because of our editor, we've got a very efficient and unique folder structure which splits into a couple of parts. The most important part is the `sloby-editor-framework` which is where all of the editor functionality code is located. We also have the `api` `components` the `lib` and the `pages` these folders are mostly dealing with everything that is not related to the editor.
